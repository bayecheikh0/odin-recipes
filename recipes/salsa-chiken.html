    <h2>This salsa chicken recipe is very easy and quick! </h2>
    <p>Someone gave me this recipe a few years back, and it has become a household favorite. Depending on your taste, you can use mild, medium, or hot salsa. I usually serve it with Spanish rice and Mexican-style canned corn.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons taco seasoning mix</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons capers</li>
        <li>1 cup salsa</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sour cream (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3> 
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Place chicken breasts in the prepared dish. Sprinkle seasoning mix on both sides of chicken breasts; pour salsa on top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is tender and juicy and the juices run clear, 25 to 35 minutes.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle chicken evenly with cheese. Continue baking until cheese is melted and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes more. Top with sour cream and serve.</li>
    </ol>
